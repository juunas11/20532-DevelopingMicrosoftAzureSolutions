#Module 4: Storing SQL Data in Azure

#Lab: Storing Event Data in Azure SQL Databases

###Scenario

Now that the web application is ready for publishing, you can begin migrating the web application to Azure by creating a database in Azure. You decided to use a database initializer and Entity Framework Code First to automate the creation of your database in SQL Database.

###Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Create an Azure SQL Database server and a database instance by using the Azure Portal.

* Use Entity Framework Code First to initialize and seed a database in the cloud.

* Use the Azure SQL Database Management Portal to view live data in the cloud.

###Lab Setup

**Estimated Time: 45 minutes**

Before starting this lab, you must complete the lab in Module 2. For the lab in this module, you will use the available host machine. Also, you must complete the following steps:

  1. On the host computer, click **Start**, type **Remote**, and then click **Remote Desktop Connection**.

  2. In Remote Desktop Connection, provide the name of your virtual machine in the **Computer** box by using the following format:

    * **vm20532[*Your Name Here*].cloudapp.net:[*Your VM RDP Port*]**

  >  **Note:** The name and port for your virtual machine might be saved in the Computer drop-down list. If this is the case, use this value instead of typing it in manually. If you are unsure about your virtual machine’s RDP port, use either of the Azure portals to find your virtual machine’s endpoints. The endpoint with the name **Remote Desktop** is the correct port for RDP. This port is randomized to protect your virtual machine from unauthorized access.

  3. In Remote Desktop Connection, click **Connect**. Wait until the RDP client accesses the virtual machine.

  4. If necessary, sign in by using the following credentials:

    * User name: **Student**

    * Password: **AzurePa\$\$w0rd**

  5. Verify that you received the credentials to sign in to the Azure portal from your training provider. You will use these credentials and the Azure account throughout the labs in this course.

##Exercise 1:	Creating an Azure SQL Databases Instance

###Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

* Create a SQL Server instance in Azure.

* Create a database in Azure.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal.

2. Create an Azure SQL database by using the Azure Portal.

####Task 1:	Sign in to the Azure Portal

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com).

####Task 2:	Create an Azure SQL database by using the Azure Portal

1. View the list of SQL databases for your subscription.

2. Create a SQL database by using the following details:

  - Name: **db20532[*Your Name Here*]**

  - Edition: **Basic**

  - Server Name: **sv20532[*Your Name Here*]**

  - Server Admin Login: **testuser**

  - Server Admin Password: **TestPa\$\$w0rd**

  - Location: **Select the region that is closest to your location**

3. Record the name of the newly created SQL Database instance.

> **Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have created both
servers and databases in the SQL Database service.

##Exercise 2:	Using Entity Framework with Azure SQL Databases

###Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

* Configure an Entity Framework Code First **DatabaseInitializer**.

* Implement a **Seed** method for the initializer.

* Publish a Cloud Services application.

* View tables and data by using the Azure SQL Database Management Portal.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Run the ASP.NET web application to view events from the local SQL database.

2. Configure DbContext with a new DatabaseInitializer.

3. Implement seed data with DbContext.

4. Publish the cloud application with updated DbContext to Azure.

5. Verify that the Azure cloud service website is using the new data.

6. Sign in to the Azure Management Portal.

7. View the migrated data in the Azure SQL Management Portal.

####Task 1:	Run the ASP.NET web application to view events from the local SQL database

1. In Visual Studio, open the **Contoso.Events** solution from the following location:

  - File location: **Allfiles (F):\\Mod04\\Labfiles\\Starter\\Contoso.Events**

2. Debug the **Contoso.Events.DataGeneration** console project.

  > **Note:** This Data Generation console application creates some sample data in your local SQL database (LocalDb) so that you can test the ASP.NET web application.

3. Debug the **Contoso.Events.Cloud** cloud project.

####Task 2:	Configure DbContext with a new DatabaseInitializer

1. In the **Contoso.Events.Data** project, create a new **EventsContextInitializer** class

2. Update the **EventsContextInitializer** class with the **public** accessor.

3. Update the **EventsContextInitializer** class to inherit from the **DbMigrationsConfiguration\<EventsContext\>** class.

4. Add a **using** statement for the **Contoso.Events.Models** namespace.

5. Update the **EventsContext** static constructor with the following lines of code:

  Database.SetInitializer\<EventsContext\>(

    new MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion\<EventsContext, EventsContextInitializer\>()

  );

####Task 3:	Implement seed data with DbContext

1. Override the **Seed** method of the **DbMigrationsConfiguration\<\>** class.

2. Add a **using** statement for the **Contoso.Events.Models** namespace.

3. At the end of the **Seed** method, create an instance of the **EventItem** class by using the following values:

  - EventKey: **"FY17SepGeneralConference"**

  - StartTime: **DateTime.Today**

  - EndTime: **DateTime.Today.AddDays(3d)**

  - Title: **"FY17 September Technical Conference"**

  - Description: **"Sed in euismod mi."**

  - RegistrationCount: **1**

4. At the end of the **Seed** method, add the newly created **EventItem** to the **context.Events** collection.

5. At the end of the **Seed** method, create an instance of the **Registration** class by using the following values:

  - EventKey: **"FY17SepGeneralConference"**

  - FirstName: **"Aisha"**

  - LastName: **"Witt"**

6. At the end of the **Seed** method, add the newly created Registration to the **context.Registrations** collection.

7. At the end of the **Seed** method, invoke the **context.SaveChanges()** method.

8. Build the **Contoso.Events.Data** project.

####Task 4:	Publish the cloud application with updated DbContext to Azure

1. Update the **Web.Release.config** file in the **Contoso.Events.Web** project to use a connection string to your Azure SQL database.

2. Publish the **Contoso.Events.Cloud** project to a new cloud service project by using the following details:

  - Name: **cs20532[*Your Name Here*]**

  - Region: **Select the region that is closest to your location**

  - Environment: **Production**

  - Build configuration: **Release**

  - Service configuration: **Cloud**

####Task 5:	Verify that the Azure cloud service website is using the new data

1. View the website for your published cloud service.

####Task 6:	Sign in to the Azure Management Portal

2. Sign in to the Azure Management Portal (https://manage.windowsazure.com).

####Task 7:	View the migrated data in the Azure SQL Management Portal

1. View the list of SQL databases for your subscription.

2. View the dashboard of your previously created SQL database:

  - Name: **db20532[*Your Name*]**

3. Sign in to the Management Portal for your SQL database by using the following values:

  - Username: **testuser**

  - Password: **TestPa\$\$w0rd**

4. View the data in the **dbo.Events** table.

> **Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have configured Entity Framework to initialize a new database with seed data.
